This assignment was straight-forward in the sense that I did not have to look anything up for it 
other than class materials. I did run into a slight hiccup while creating the objects, however.
Javascript syntax is unique and interesting! It amuses me how it just works! 

Experimenting with objects and console output has inspired me to look further on the webpages 
that I visit. I now know a bit more of syntax as well as debugging methods. Indexing the objects was 
also slightly different from other programming languages I have used but mostly similar.

Also this reference helped! :
