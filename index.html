		<p>This is the HTML document for Assignment 02</p>

		<p>Don't worry about any of the HTML code, just put your JavaScript code into
		the &lt;script&gt; block below</p>

		
		<h2>View your Code</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>In Firefox, select Tools -&lt; Browser Tools -&lt; Web Developer Tools</li>
			<li>In Chrome, select View -&lt; Developer -&lt; Developer Tools </li>

/*
	First, this is a <script> block inside of an html document

	Any code you write here be run by the browser's JavaScript interpreter every 
	time the page is loaded, and will available to you in the browser's console. 

*/



/*
	Second, any text between the slash/star above and star/slash 
	below, is a _comment_ - an area of this document that will
	be ignored by the computer

	Programmers use comments to add notes or explanations
	about what the code is doing so others (or you in six months)
	will be better able to understand what is happening 

	It is also useful for hiding code for a while if something isn't
	working - you can make changes or add back one step at a time 
	to see what is causing your code to break

 */

// you can also have single line comments using two slashes



/*

	Third, to get to the console:

		In Firefox, select Tools -> Browser Tools -> Web Developer Tools
		In Chrome, select View -> Developer -> Developer Tools 

	After the split screen tools window opens, select the "Console" tab from the top 

 */




/*
	If you type "console.log()" with something inside the parentheses - a string
	of text, a variable name, a number, some math equation, etc - the resulting
	answer or value will be printed out
 */
console.log("This is Assignment 2 for XA310")



/*
	For this assignment, you will need to create an object that stores
	some information about a type of "thing" 

	For example, something that describes a dog. The name you give 
	your object doesn't matter much, but it should be in camelCase if 
	it is more than one word

*/

const myDogObject = {
	"name" : "Nezzy",
	"age" : 0,
	"color" : "Black"
}


/* 
	You can now log it to the console, by using the
	variable name with no quotes
 */
//console.log(myDogObject)



/* 

	Part 1:

	Create TWO objects with at least FIVE properties below.

	These will represent two instances of your "thing", meaning they have the
	same properties but different values for each
*/

const carObject = [
{
	"make" : "Volvo",
	"model" : "XC60 T6 4D",
	"type" : "SUV",
	"color" : "red",
	"horsepower" : 281
},

{
	"make" : "Honda",
	"model" : "CR-V",
	"type" : "SUV",
	"color" : "white",
	"horsepower" : 185
}
]

/*
const gameSystem = {
	"brand" : "Microsoft",
	"system" : "Xbox",
	"gbstorage" : 128,
	"mbram" : 64,
	"release year" : 2001
}
*/



/* 
	Part 2:

	Use console.log() to print both of your objects to the console in their
	entirety

*/

console.log(carObject[0])
console.log(carObject[1])



/*
	Part 3:

	Use console.log() to print to print the one of the same properties from each
	object - for example, if you have a "size", print the size from object 1,
	then the size from object 2.

	Then do it a second time with a different property.

console.log(carObject[0].make)
console.log(carObject[1].make)
